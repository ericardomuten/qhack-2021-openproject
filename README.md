### Abstract

This project aims to use the method of modified layerwise learning[8] on data re-uploading classifier[6], where parametrized quantum circuit will be used as quantum classifiers to classify the SUSY dataset[1]. We managed to produce a better result using this approach compared to the previous related research[2] with less number of qubit. We obtained AUC of 0.8488 on testing dataset with 5000 training and testing samples, trained and tested using a simulator. We also tested to run the circuit on Rigetti's Aspen-9 QPU provided by AWS using the already optimized parameter to predict 2000 samples of test dataset and we obtained AUC of 0.8298.


### Acknowledgment 

This work is submitted to the [QHack 2021](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2021) organized by [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/). During the hackathon, we had the opportunity to learn and implement ideas in the field of QML. It was a pleasure to be part of this hackathon, and as a team, we would like to thank all the speakers for their valuable presentations and the Xanadu team for organizing an amazing event. Thanks to [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/), we received a total of $4250 in AWS credits to execute our code on real quantum hardware.

### Note
The final notebook is [here](https://github.com/eraraya-ricardo/qhack-2021-openproject/blob/main/QHack_Final.ipynb). GitHub sometimes failed to render Jupyter Notebook's markdown properly, so in case of that please use this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eraraya-ricardo/qhack-2021-openproject/blob/main/QHack_Final.ipynb) to see the notebook in nbviewer. <br>
The final notebook is the clean version of the code that by itself should be enough to reproduce the results, but all the testing/temporary codes and other files used in this project are available at the [Old GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VoicuTomut/Event-Classification-with-data-reuploading-in-High-Energy-Physics).
Our numerical results from the Rigetti's QPU device are [here](https://github.com/eraraya-ricardo/qhack-2021-openproject/tree/main/QPU%20Results).
